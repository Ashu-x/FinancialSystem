## Problem Statement

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Provisioning for Finance System**

Automate the provisioning of infrastructure for a Finance system using Infrastructure as Code tools such as Terraform or Ansible. The project involves script-based deployment of local Docker environments or cloud instances (e.g., AWS), including automated installation of core dependencies. This approach eliminates manual configuration errors and enables repeatable, scalable environment setup.

---

## Overview

This project focuses on automating infrastructure provisioning and deployment for a Finance System using IaC principles.

The emphasis is on:
- Automation
- Reproducibility
- Scalability
- Zero manual configuration
- CI/CD integration

Application development is not the primary focus. Infrastructure automation is.
