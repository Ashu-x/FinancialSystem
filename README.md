## Problem Statement

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Provisioning for Finance System

This project focuses on automating the provisioning of infrastructure for a Finance System using Infrastructure as Code tools such as Terraform and Ansible.  
The system supports automated deployment of local Docker environments and cloud infrastructure (such as AWS) along with automatic installation of required dependencies.

This approach reduces manual configuration, minimizes human errors, and enables repeatable and scalable infrastructure setup.

---

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to automate infrastructure provisioning and deployment for a Finance System using IaC principles.

The primary focus areas are:
- Infrastructure automation
- Reproducible environments
- Scalable deployment
- Zero manual server configuration
- CI/CD based deployment

Application development is not the primary focus of this project.  
The main focus is infrastructure automation.
